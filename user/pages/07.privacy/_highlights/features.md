### Privacy matters

We like to think that  a holiday at **The Croft House** will give you all the privacy that you could hope for. We'd like you to have that the same level of security and privacy on our website too, that's why we chose [Digital Freedom](http://digitalfreedom.me) to build our site from scratch.

We don't store any information regarding your visit to the site

We don't collect any cookies when you visit our site, unusual in this day and age unless you choose to block cookies yourself. However, there are a couple of pages where third parties do use cookies. The 'Location' page uses Google Maps, so unless you choose to block them, there are some Cookies from their services ... without them the maps can't automatically help with directions. At the foot of the 'Harris' page we have a Twitter Feed, it's a great way to quickly find items of interest when you arrive and couldn't be more up to date. We have to allow Twitter to use cookies to benefit from this service, though, again, you can block them if you wish.
Here are the [Google](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/) and [Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170514-twitters-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies) policies.

We prefer that you get in touch with us through our [contact](/booking) form, or alternatively you can use this [email](mailto:thecrofthouseborve.com) address. We will only use your email address to keep in touch with you and we will disclose or share your personal data only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or legal process served on us or the website.

If you'd rather contact us through a non electronic means you can find us here ...
