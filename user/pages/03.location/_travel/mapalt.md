### Arriving on the Island

It is worth noting that depending whether you arrive via Tarbert, Leverburgh or Stornoway on a Saturday evening, a bit of forward planning may be needed.
Stornoway has a large [Co-op](http://www.co-operative.coop/find-us/?q=stornoway&lat=58.209435&long=-6.384869200000026&filters=Food&options=) and [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/store-locator/uk/?bID=5762) open until 10pm on Saturdays, allowing time to stock up on provisions even if you arrive on the last ferry or flight. However, if you arrive on the later ferries into Tarbert or Leverburgh you won't be able to do a grocery shopping until Moday without driving up to the supermarkets in Stornoway, almost an hour and a half away.


### Travelling around the Outer Hebrides

Once you have arrived there are a number of ways to travel around.

Buses from Stornoway and Tarbert run past the cottage from Monday to Saturday. There is no Sunday bus service.

[Harris Outdoor Adventure](http://www.harrisoutdoor.co.uk/) not far from **The Croft House** at Leverburgh, hire a variety of mountain and road bikes and kayaks.
