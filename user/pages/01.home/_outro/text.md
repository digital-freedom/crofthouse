We believe Harris has something for everyone, at all times of year, and at all times of the day. [Archie](http://www.kenmorephotography.smugmug.com/) caught this fabulous display of the Northern Lights during our photo-shoot for the website.

Take leisurely walks along the secluded beach on your doorstep, as the access to this beach is not obvious from the road, you will find it a quiet spot to spend a sunny day. This coast has some of the best beaches in the Western Isles, with the world famous [Luskentyre](http://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/luskentyre-on-isle-of-harris-in-top-ten-uk-beaches-1-3693482 "Scotsman article on Luskentyre") beach only a 10 minute drive, and the sheltered Horgabost and Scarista beaches only 2 minutes away.

Our beaches aren't just for lazy days, and **The Croft House** is two minutes away from the [Isle of Harris Golf Club](http://www.harrisgolf.com/ "Harris Golf Club website") and their 9 hole course at Scarista. You will need to be quick to apply if you want to play in the annual Harris Open, but you do get the chance to win a [jacket](http://www.golfbytourmiss.com/2013/09/isle-of-harris-golf-club-home-to-golfs-most-expensive-item-of-apparel/ "Golf by TourMiss article") to rival any other competition!

Away from the beaches, we recommend a visit to [The Temple Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/TheTempleCafe "The Temple Cafe Facebook page"). They are celebrating their well deserved [Wilderness Scotland](http://www.wildernessscotland.com/blog/our-pick-of-scotlands-best-restaurants/ "Wilderness Scotland - Scotlandâ€™s Best Restaurants") Best Restaurant award.

Of course, it doesn't have to be so relaxed ... fishing, walking, cycling, kayaking, kite surfing - we have plenty of suggestions for you on our [Useful Links](/links) page.
