####Further afield

To the north west of Tarbert, a winding 14 mile single track road reaches a magnificent conclusion at Hushinish, with a beautiful soft sand beach.  There are fantastic views to neighbouring islands, including Taransay and Scarp (the setting for the acclaimed feature film, The Rocket Post).  The road actually passes through the grounds of Amhuinnsuidhe Castle, built in 1865 for the 7th Earl of Dunmore.

Also a little way along this road is the most remote tennis court in Britain. In a beautiful setting overlooking the Atlantic ocean on the road to Hushinish, in North Harris, the new court at Bunabhainneadar offers a top class artificial grass surface and a cosy wooden pavilion (in case it rains and blows a hooly!).
