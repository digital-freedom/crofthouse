Tarbert is the main town in Harris. It has a few small shops, a tourist info office, bank and ferry terminal for ferries to and from Uig on the Isle of Skye and Lochmaddy on North Uist.

Harris Tweed is still woven by crofters here on the Isle of Harris, on traditional foot driven pedal looms and weaving demonstrations are available. In Tarbert, there’s a large Harris Tweed shop with plenty to interest those taking holidays in the Isle of Harris. A little way south is the Isle of Harris Knitwear Company, where you’ll find designer Harris Tweed products. Many of them are so individual that they can tell you the weaver.
