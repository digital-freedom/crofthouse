In the south of the Isle of Harris, near the small sheltered harbour of Rodel you can visit the ancient St. Clement’s church, where Clan Macleod chiefs worshipped since the 1500s. The [Rodel Hotel](http://www.rodelhotel.co.uk/index.html?pid=49) serves great food (local seafood) or stop in for a coffee or drink at the bar.

At the southern tip of the Isle of Harris lies the small ferry port of Leverburgh, where a ferry weaves its way, several times a day (including Sundays) around the reefs and shallow water of the Sound of Harris to the Island of Berneray inn North Uist. There is also a community owned co-operative shop that will service all your needs in the food and drink department.  Leverburgh has a hostel, post office, hairdressers, café, seafood restaurant & bar (The Anchorage), outdoor sports hire centre and gallery.
