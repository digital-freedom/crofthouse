### Places to see
The Isle of Harris is full of contrasting scenery across the island. Mountains and moonscape landscapes in the north, give over to the rich machair and miles of stunning, golden sandy beaches of the south/west.

There is a nine-hole golf course at Scarista which has breathtakingly stunning views and golfers skills can be tested by the elements.

Leave plenty of time to make the trip up the west coast, as you’re sure to want to stop and walk some of the wonderful shell-sand beaches.  The most notable are Scarista, Borve, Nisabost, Seilebost, Horgabost and Luskentyre.
