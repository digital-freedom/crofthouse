You can drive round south Harris’s circular road in around three hours, but it is likely to take you longer, as you there will be frequent stops to take in the stunning land and seascapes. It’s really worth visiting the villages set amongst the rocky inlets of the Bays area of the east coast, such as Ardvey and Flodabay.  Then experience the deep contrast with Seilabost and Horgabost set among the sandy inlets and machair of the west coast.  Around the villages, you’ll find local cafes, art and craft galleries and other small enterprises with quality local products.
