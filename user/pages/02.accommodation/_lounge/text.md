### The Lounge.

The lounge is a cosy cottage living area, with south and west facing windows - perfect for catching the sun setting over the Atlantic Ocean! With comfortable seating, a TV, a docking station for your digital music and free Internet access it is the perfect spot to relax after a day of adventure. The multifuel stove can burn peat, the traditional fuel of the island. The smell of burning peat is distinctive, and often best enjoyed with a relaxing dram, possibly from the nearby [Isle of Harris Distillers](http://www.harrisdistillery.com/). 

There is also a family dining table at the west facing window.
