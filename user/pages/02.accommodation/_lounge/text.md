### The Lounge.

The lounge is a cosy cottage living area, with south and west facing windows - perfect for catching the sun setting over the Atlantic Ocean! With comfortable seating, a TV, a docking station for your digital music and free Internet access it is the perfect spot to relax after a day of adventure. We supply a starter pack for the multi fuel stove, for the perfect end to a busy day exploring Harris the fire can be enjoyed with a relaxing dram, possibly from the nearby [Isle of Harris Distillers](http://www.harrisdistillery.com/). (Their whisky is still a few year off, but an [Isle of Harris Gin](http://www.harrisdistillery.com/spirits/isle-harris-gin) is a tempting proposition.)

There is also a family dining table at the west facing window.
