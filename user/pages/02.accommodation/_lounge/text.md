### The Lounge.

The lounge is a cosy cottage living area, with south and west facing windows - perfect for catching the sun setting over the Atlantic Ocean! With comfortable seating, a TV, a docking station for your digital music and free Internet access it is the perfect spot to relax after a day of adventure. The starter kit of kindling, logs and coal for the multiuel stove also contains peat, the traditional fuel of the island. The smell of burning peat is distinctive, and often best enjoyed with a relaxing dram, possibly from the nearby [Abhainn Dearg](http://www.abhainndearg.co.uk/) distillery.

There is also a family dining table at the west facing window.
