### Borve is a traditional crofting village in West Harris.

**The Croft House** is a comfortable modernised island cottage with 2 bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, bathroom and a porch.  It has a large sunny west facing garden with a bench to sit and enjoy the views. The cottage is fully furnished and has a multi-fuel burning stove, shower, fully kitted kitchen and comfortable beds.

The cottage is non-smoking, pet friendly (for well-behaved animals) and we provide a starter pack of kindling, logs, coal and peat for the multi-fuel stove.  The phone signal in the cottage only works for Vodafone so we provide a sim card with a limited amount on it in case you need to make a call whilst at home. The sim can be topped up as required.
