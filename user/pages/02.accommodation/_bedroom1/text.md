### Bedroom 1

Whether you are planning an adventurous holiday sampling some of the excellent outdoor activities Harris has to offer, or a more relaxed time enjoying our wide range of arts and craft galleries and places to eat out, a good night's sleep is always welcome.

The main bedroom is a spacious double room with a west facing window. It includes bedside cabinets and two large sets of drawers.
